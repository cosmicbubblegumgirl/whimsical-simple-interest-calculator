## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for setting the tone of the community and enforcing this Code of Conduct fairly and consistently.

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, pull requests, discussions, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. When appropriate, they should explain moderation decisions clearly and respectfully.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces, including:

All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled as fairly as possible. Maintainers will respect the privacy and safety of the person making a report.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When deciding how to respond to a violation, maintainers may consider the severity of the behavior, whether it is repeated, and the impact it had on others.

Possible responses may include:

1. **Friendly correction** - A private or public reminder about expected behavior.
2. **Warning** - A clear notice that the behavior is unacceptable and must stop.
3. **Temporary restriction** - Limited participation in discussions, issues, or contributions for a set period.

The goal of enforcement is to protect the community, encourage accountability, and keep the project constructive for everyone.
