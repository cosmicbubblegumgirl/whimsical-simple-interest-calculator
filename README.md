# Whimsical Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple and playful web app that calculates simple interest.

I wanted this project to feel light, friendly, and easy to use, so instead of making it look too formal, I gave it a softer and more cheerful style. The app takes three values from the user:

- Principal amount
- Rate of interest
- Time period

Once those values are entered, it calculates the simple interest using the standard formula:

**Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**
simple interest = (p*t*r)/100

## Why I made this

This project is a small practice app for working with basic web development. It is useful for learning how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can come together to build something interactive.

It also helped me practice:

- creating form inputs
- handling button clicks
- validating user input
- doing simple calculations in JavaScript
- designing a cleaner and more user-friendly layout

## Files in this project

- `index.html` – the full app, including structure, styling, and logic
- `README.md` – project overview and instructions

## How to use it

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. Enter the principal amount
4. Enter the rate of interest
5. Enter the time period
6. Click the **Calculate** button

The app will display the simple interest instantly.

## Example

If the principal is `1000`, the rate is `5`, and the time is `2`, then:

`(1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100`

So the simple interest is **100**.
